# SSH KEY no Linux

Linux users might need to type their username and password everytime they need to run `git push` on bash. In order to avoid this, one should create a SSH connection between their machine and Github. Once this done, that authentication will perform automatically.

For doing so, run the follow script

```bash
bash ./generate.sh "your.github@email.com"
```

Once it's executed, the console will demand you a name for a file it'll put the SSH key. If we only push Enter, its name and location will be `/home/usuÃ¡rio/.ssh/id_rsa`(the standard). Moreover, it'll also require you to type a pass for this key. I personally recomend you to push Enter.

Now, sign in on GitHub, click onto your profile photo locate on right top corner and click Settings. On the left-sidebar, go to SSH > GPG Keys

As you click SSH key, choose a title which represents the computer where the keyy is going to be storage, copy all content of `id_rsa.pub` (located on your explorer `/home/yourUser/.ssh`) and past it on the Key field.

Well done! Just, from now on, whenever you clone a repo from Github, make sure to set the domain as SSH and not HTTP!
